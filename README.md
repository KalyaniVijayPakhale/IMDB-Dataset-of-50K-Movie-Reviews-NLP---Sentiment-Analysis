Py Notebook:
The notebook contains detailed EDA on the 50k movie dataset. whereas the dataset contains reviews with their sentiment such as positive or negative.
we have an equal amount of data for positive and negative comments.

Multiple NLP algorithms have been performed on the dataset. such as Logistic regression, support vector machine, Gradient descent, etc
so after applying these algorithms "Logistic regression" gives more accuracy rate compared to other algorithms.
